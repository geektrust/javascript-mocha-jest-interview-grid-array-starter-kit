# javascript-interview-grid-array-starter-kit

# Introduction

- This is a skeleton project structure for problems that expect a 2D integer grid as input. It will help you start solving grid-related problems right away. The project provides a simple structure to parse the input, process it, and return the expected output.

## Tools available to you

- Node.js

## Checking for correctness

- You can click on the Run IO button from the interview application, which will run your solution against some preconfigured inputs and show you the output.

## Running the project

- To run, issue the command `node . '<input>'` where **input** is a valid input given in the problem statement.
- For example: `node . '1,2,3|4,5,6|7,8,9'`

## Output

- The handle() function processes the input and returns the output, which will be printed by the main() function.
